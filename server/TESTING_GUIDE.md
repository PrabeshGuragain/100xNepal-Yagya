### Step 5: Test the API

You have several options to test:

#### Option A: Using Swagger UI (Recommended - Easiest)

1. Open browser and go to: **http://localhost:8000/docs**
2. Find the **`POST /travel/plan`** endpoint
3. Click "Try it out"
4. Use this sample request body:

```json
{
  "destination": "Paris, France",
  "days": 3,
  "origin": "New York",
  "travel_type": "cultural",
  "budget": "medium",
  "preferences": "museums, food, historic sites",
  "date": "June 2024"
}
```

5. Click "Execute"
6. Wait for the response (may take 30-60 seconds as the agent uses tools)

#### Option B: Using curl (Command Line)

```bash
curl -X POST "http://localhost:8000/travel/plan" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "destination": "Tokyo, Japan",
    "days": 5,
    "travel_type": "cultural",
    "budget": "medium",
    "preferences": "temples, food, technology"
  }'
```

#### Option C: Using Python requests

Create `test_travel_api.py`:

```python
import requests
import json

url = "http://localhost:8000/travel/plan"

payload = {
    "destination": "Bali, Indonesia",
    "days": 4,
    "travel_type": "adventure",
    "budget": "low to medium",
    "preferences": "beaches, temples, water sports"
}

response = requests.post(url, json=payload)
print("Status:", response.status_code)
print("\nResponse:")
print(json.dumps(response.json(), indent=2))
```

Run it:
```bash
python test_travel_api.py
```

#### Option D: Using Postman/Insomnia

1. Create new POST request
2. URL: `http://localhost:8000/travel/plan`
3. Headers: `Content-Type: application/json`
4. Body (JSON):
```json
{
  "destination": "Rome, Italy",
  "days": 7,
  "travel_type": "cultural",
  "preferences": "ancient history, food, art"
}
```

### Step 6: Check Health Endpoint

Test if the service is ready:

```bash
curl http://localhost:8000/travel/health
```

Or visit: http://localhost:8000/travel/health

Should return:
```json
{
  "status": "healthy",
  "service": "travel_planning",
  "agent_initialized": true
}
```

---

### Step 7: Verify Response

A successful response should include:

```json
{
  "success": true,
  "itinerary": {
    "summary": "...",
    "destination": "Paris",
    "total_days": 3,
    "day_plans": [
      {
        "day_number": 1,
        "title": "...",
        "description": "...",
        "activities": [...]
      }
    ],
    "top_attractions": [...],
    "accommodation_recommendations": [...],
    "general_tips": [...]
  },
  "processing_time": 45.2
}
```

## Troubleshooting

### Error: "GOOGLE_API_KEY is required"

**Solution:**
- Make sure `.env` file exists in `server/` directory
- Check that `GOOGLE_API_KEY=your-actual-key` is in the file
- Restart the server after adding the key

### Error: Import errors (langchain, etc.)

**Solution:**
```bash
# Reinstall dependencies
uv sync
# or
pip install -e . --force-reinstall
```

### Error: "No module named 'duckduckgo_search'"

**Solution:**
```bash
pip install duckduckgo-search beautifulsoup4
```

### Server won't start

**Check:**
1. Port 8000 is not already in use
2. All dependencies are installed
3. Python version is 3.11+

### Agent takes too long / timeout

**Normal behavior:**
- First request may take 1-2 minutes (agent initialization)
- Subsequent requests: 30-60 seconds
- The agent uses multiple tools which takes time

**If timeout:**
- Check internet connection (agent needs to search)
- Verify Gemini API key is valid
- Check server logs for errors

## Sample Test Cases

### Minimal Request (Just Destination)
```json
{
  "destination": "London"
}
```

### Full Request
```json
{
  "destination": "New York City",
  "days": 5,
  "origin": "Los Angeles",
  "travel_type": "mixed",
  "budget": "high budget $5000",
  "preferences": "nightlife, shopping, Broadway shows",
  "date": "December 2024",
  "notes": "First time visit, prefer walking"
}
```

### Different Travel Types
```json
{
  "destination": "Jerusalem",
  "days": 4,
  "travel_type": "religious"
}
```

---

## Expected Response Time

- **First request:** 60-120 seconds (agent initialization)
- **Subsequent requests:** 30-90 seconds
- **Simple destinations:** 30-45 seconds
- **Complex multi-day plans:** 60-120 seconds

This is normal - the agent is:
1. Searching for information
2. Getting ratings and reviews
3. Comparing prices
4. Ranking attractions
5. Generating detailed itinerary
6. Validating output

## Next Steps

1. âœ… Test with different destinations
2. âœ… Try different travel types
3. âœ… Test with various preferences
4. âœ… Check response includes images (when available)
5. âœ… Verify day_plans have detailed activities
6. âœ… Confirm ratings and costs are included

Happy Testing! ðŸš€
